            Blogs are much appreciated across the internet. Blogs can be very valuable for businesses. 
            Personal blogs have been made like a million times by Web Devs already, but user-generated blogs that have a built-in markdown editor,
            review algorithm and everything else needed to have a self-sustaining blog is something not many have made, 
            yet is something that is a lot more valuable to businesses that want their blog to grow organically and bring in traffic.
